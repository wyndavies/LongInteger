The containing application was created in Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition, using MFC.
The LongInteger class itself only uses CString from MFC.

The naming I used for the files is horrible. The containing application used to test the "LongInteger" class is called "LongIntegers". So the file names are all really similar and can lead to confusion.
