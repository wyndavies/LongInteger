<b>The containing application was created in Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition, using MFC.</b>

The naming I used for the files is horrible. The containing application used to test the "LongInteger" class is called "LongIntegers". So the file names are all really similar and can lead to confusion.

The program was created on Windows (obviously as it was done in Visual Studio), however the LongInteger class has been modified so that it also compiles and runs on Linux (tested on Ubuntu 16).

The test file used in Linux is as below:

Classes needed to run this on Linux are:
LongInteger
LongIntWrapper
MyHardwareInfo
QueueOfThreads
ReceivedUpdateClass
DummyCalledClass (will be removed as a dependency in an update, but still using it to test stuff right now)
