// Based on code by Roman Pasechnik for his PrimeSwing algorithm for calculating factorials
// The code has been changed somewhat as it was originally meant for numbers held as 2's compliment.
// My LongInteger class uses a separate flag for positive/negative and the number is stored in the same
// way regardless of sign. Hence I modified the code. I used an array instead of calculating the number
// of bytes each time.
